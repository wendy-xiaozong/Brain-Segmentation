# To do
- [X] get the path
- [X] using patch-based pipelines
- [X] read about multi-classification
- [X] test if the metrics works
- [ ] tune the patch based parameters to make the train faster
- [ ] use cropped image to train
- [ ] remember to find the suitable patch size
- [ ] make a parameter of whether to compute the background
- [ ] to test the dice loss


## Try
- [ ] using leave one out validation


# The elements of networks
- loss function and matrixs: all compute the background
